# Amazon-Product-Review-
Welcome to the Amazon Product Review Repository! In this repository, I analyzed and reviewed Amazon Products by categories, discount, reviews, revenue and more. The project serves as a guide to sellers on the Amazon Platform to guide them in making informed decisions.

## Understanding the Project
Upon receiving this project to work on, the first thing I did was to read carefully through the Case Study for the Amazon Product Review Analysis. This gave me the understanding of what the required outputs from this Dataset are.

With the understanding of what the required outputs are, I went on to load the data-set into my Excel Application. I sent quite a number of hours going through the entire data-set, having in mind the required results. This gave me clear understanding of the required columns I need to retain, the columns that are not need for my analysis, and the missing columns that I would need to create to ensure that I am able to analyze the Data-set and come out with the desired report that would make Sellers on the Amazon Platform reach an informed decision.

I also found out that the data-set contains 1466 Rows and 16 Columns with the first row being the Header.

The 16 columns are: product_id, product_name, category, discounted_price, actual_price, discount_percentage, rating, rating_count, about_product, user_id, user_name, review_id, review_title, review_content, img_link, product_link

## Data Cleaning
I started the Data Cleaning by deleting the columns that are not required just by holding down the control-key and selecting all the columns to be delected, then right-clicking and clicking delete.

Having delected the columns that I don't require, I went further in the Data-Cleaning by deleting duplicate rows using the product-key column.
